# Create a new repo
git init foo

# Clone an existing repo
git clone https://github.com/srdjanma/sergio92

# What is a repo?
A file tree with a special .git directory at the top which stores
commit and file data info, allowing you go see all changes from the beginning.

# Typical workflow
0. Fetch the latest changes
   'git fetch'         : grab all of the latest changes
   'git pull --rebase' : put any recent changes ontop of remote changes

1. Edit a file (useful increment of work, smaller better)
   emacs/vim/gedit lib/func.c

2. Review changes
   'git status' : list files which were modified
   'git diff'   : show changes as diffs

3. Add changes to git index (will ask you about whether to include each chunk of work)
   'git add -p' : add to index, -p means patch

4. Changes are now staged
   'git diff'          : will not show anything now...
   'git diff --cached' : will show the changes about to be committed.

5. Commit changes
   "git commit -m 'Modified lib/func.c, added frobnicate() method.'"

6. See changes in history
   'git log'        : Show author/date/commit ids
   'git log -p'     : Show commits with changes
   'git log --stat' : Show lines changed per file per commit

7. Publish changes to github
   'git push origin master' : git push means to push the changes
                            : origin is local (default) name of the repo
                            : master is the (default) name of the branch
